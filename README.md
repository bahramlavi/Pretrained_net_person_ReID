# Pretrained_net_person_ReID
At this provided code, a Covlotional Neural Network (CNN) model employed which provided in the Caffe library, BVLC Reference CaffeNet to generate image represation for person re-identification. In this manner, the network takes images a re-id dataset as input, and return corresponding verctor representations as the output of the fully connected layer, fc7. 

This has be evaluated on both VIPeR and CUHK02 datasets. 

Note that before running the code, make sure you provided the pathes for caffe and the datasets, accordingly.
